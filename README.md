## About

Some simple computer vision implementations using OpenCV such as:

- Extracting facial landmarks for facial analysis by applying filters and face swaps.
- Approximating contours, contour filtering and ordering.Segmenting images by understanding contours, circle, and line detection.
- Feature detection (SIFT and ORB) to do object detection and implementing dbject detection for faces and cars.
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) applied to image.
